## Installation

Currently if you'd like to install and use MudForge you'll need to download the code, or clone the repo, and use cargo run if you have Rust installed.

I will make an installer soon.

## Usage

Currently there is only basic functionality included. If you'd like to connect to a mud, simply go to "Connection" -> "New" in the menu, and enter your
host name and port number. Then you'll be connected to your game! Enjoy!
